<h1>RDM in a nutshell</h1>
<p>Research Data Management (RDM) aims to improve the research <strong>efficiency and transparency</strong>, and to fulfill the <strong>requirements</strong> of the university, funders, and legislation. The Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour (DI) uses a Data Repository (DR) for data management. The repository serves three purposes:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Data preservation</strong> for internal reuse</li>
<li><strong>Research documentation</strong> for increasing reusability and reproducibility</li>
<li><strong>Data sharing</strong> with the external scientific community</li>
</ol>
<p>The data repository allows a researcher to archive digital data into <strong>collections</strong>. It contains separate collections for preservation, for research documentation and for sharing:</p>
<ol>
<li>In a <strong>Data Acquisition Collection</strong> (DAC), the data are archived in their original form. Here, original means without any manipulations that limit future analyses of these data.</li>
<li>A <strong>Research Documentation Collection</strong> (RDC) documents the process via which data are converted into published results.</li>
<li>A <strong>Data Sharing Collection</strong> (DSC) contains the data that on which published results are based, allowing external researchers to extend scientific findings by reanalyzing data with new methods, and/or by addressing new research questions using these data.</li>
</ol>
<p>Repository users can have different predefined roles in a collection. These roles differ in their rights with respect to the collection:1. A <strong>manager</strong> can add and remove users to the collection, and can change the role of other users. A manager also has the rights of a contributor.2. A <strong>contributor</strong> can add, modify and delete files. A contributor also has the rights of a viewer.3. A <strong>viewer</strong> can view the collection details and content and can download files.Collections are always initiated by one of the research<strong> administrators </strong>that is part of the DI's administrative staff. As a part of the initiation, the research administrator assigns a manager to the collection; typically this is the supervisor of the research project to which this collection belongs. A collection manager can add other users to the collection in the role of manager, and these then obtain the same rights.</p>
<p>The three collections are built at different stages of a research project, see the figure below. For how to request the three collections, please check the DI <a title="DI Intranet" href="https://intranet.donders.ru.nl/index.php?id=4977">Intranet</a> (for researchers in the DCCN) or the <a href="https://www.ru.nl/donders/research/data/presentations/">introductory presentation</a> (for researchers in the DCC). Note that an empirical research project can start from existing DACs and/or DSCs, and therefore it is not required that new data have to be acquired for such a project.</p>
