<h2>1. What if my institute is not listed in the login window?</h2>
<p>If your institute is not listed when you try to log in, you should contact the person who is responsible for SURFconext at your institution and ask for your institute to be allowed to access the Donders Repository. You can contact SURFconext (support@surfconext.nl) to find out who is responsible at your institution. When contacting SURFconext, you can use this template email:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dear SURFconext support team,</p>
<p>I am employed by [the name of your university/institute] and would like to get access to the <em>Donders Repository</em>, a service to which I can get access via SURFconext. Could you give me the contact details of the SURFconext person of my organization?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In case your institute does not use SURFconext, you can use any of your social accounts (Google, LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, MicroSoft) via the <strong>Onegini</strong> option to log in. With a social account the access to data is limited to published Data Sharing Collections. You cannot be added to Data Acquisition Collections or Research Documentation Collections with a social account.</p>
<p>For further questions on authenticating yourself, contact datasupport@donders.ru.nl.</p>
<h2>2. What is SURFconext?</h2>
<p>SURFconext allows all academic institutes and schools in The Netherlands to use a single login. SURFconext allows you to access online services with the username and password issued by your own institution.</p>
<p>In SURFconext your personal details are only provided to a service provider (such as the Donders Repository) if these details are needed to use the service.</p>
<h2>3. In my browser I cannot select any institution. What should I do?</h2>
<p>The dialog box to select your institution can be used in most popular browsers, including Internet Explorer, Firefox, Chrome, and Safari. Other browsers may not be supported. Your browser must support the use of cookies and JavaScript.</p>
<h2>4. What is an ORCID-iD?</h2>
<p>ORCID provides you with a unique individual and persistent digital identifier that enables you to connect research contributions and to share information on large scale with other researchers. You can login to the Donders Repository using your ORCID-iD. Read how to create and ORCID-iD on the webpage (<a href="https://orcid.org/">https://orcid.org/</a>).</p>
<h2>5. What is an Onegini account?</h2>
<p>Onegini allows you to create a digital identity that can be used to access repository. You can use Google+, LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter or Microsoft account to login to the Donders Repository via Onegini. Read how to create an Onegini account on the Onegini webpage (<a href="https://www.onegini.com/">https://www.onegini.com/</a>).</p>
<h2>6. Can I have multiple user profiles in the repository?</h2>
<p>One person can have multiple user profiles in the repository, e.g. if that person has an account at multiple universities, or if that person uses both his academic account and his social account. If you log in to the Donders Repository with different accounts, your profiles are likely to have access to different collections in different roles. Different accounts from the same user cannot be linked.</p>
<h2>7. Who is an author of a Data Sharing Collection (DSC)?</h2>
<p>Within the repository, an author is a person who has made a significant contribution to the acquisition or analysis of the data that comprises a published data sharing collection.</p>
<p>Note that by assigning an author to a DSC, that person does not automatically have access to the data or details of that collection. Being an &lsquo;author&rsquo; does not add any privileges to the role of the user within the repository.</p>
<h2>8. What are the differences between the roles in a collection?</h2>
<p>A <strong>viewer</strong> can view the collection details and content and can download files.</p>
<p>A contributor can add, modify and delete files in the collection and can update the collection details (title, abstract, keywords, etc.). Furthermore, a contributor has all the rights that a viewer has.</p>
<p>A <strong>manager</strong> can add and remove users to the collection, including other managers, and can change the role of other users. A manager can also irreversibly archive a collection. Furthermore, a manager has all the rights that a viewer and a contributor have.</p>
<p>Carefully consider it if you want to add someone else as a manager to the collection. The managers jointly share the responsibility for the collection. One manager can remove another manager from the collection. You should only make someone manager if you believe that this person would make the same decisions that you would make yourself, and would consult you in case of doubt.</p>
<h2>9. Who can be assigned to the different roles?</h2>
<p>To be assigned for all roles the user must have an authenticated account (e.g. <a href="https://www.surf.nl/en/services-and-products/surfconext/index.html">SURFconext</a>). Users with an ORCID-iD cannot be assigned as manager. Users with a social account cannot be assigned as a manager or a contributor.</p>
<p>To be assigned as a manager the user has to be added to one of the participating organizational units (DCC, DCCN, DCMN, DCN) by that unit&rsquo;s research administrator. In this way, it is ensured that only the members of an organizational unit can be assigned the responsibility that comes with the manager role.</p>
<h2>10. How should I request a Data Acquisition Collection/Research Documentation Collection/ Data Sharing Collection (DAC/RDC/DSC)?</h2>
<p>The way to request a collection differs per <a href="https://www.ru.nl/donders/research/data/faq/get-started/#he5c498f9-e41f-45f0-ac77-ef1c397a4c4c">organization unit</a>. For details please check the Intranet of Donders Institute: <a href="https://intranet.donders.ru.nl/">https://intranet.donders.ru.nl/</a></p>
<h2>11. What are the different Collection types?</h2>
<p>There are three collection types, one for data acquisition (Data Acquisition Collection), one for research documentation (Research Documentation Collection) and one for data sharing (Data Sharing Collection).</p>
<p><strong>Data Acquisition Collection (DAC).</strong> In a Data Acquisition Collection, the <a href="https://www.ru.nl/donders/research/data/faq/get-started/#h123fe67c-909c-4b7c-8749-9d624153c53c">research data</a> are archived in their original form. Here, &ldquo;original&rdquo; means without any manipulations that limit future analyses of these data. To learn more about the files that you must upload to a Research Data Collection, see this FAQ.</p>
<p><strong>Research Documentation Collection (RDC)</strong><strong>.</strong> When a paper is accepted for publication, the associated RDC must document the process via which data are converted into the to-be-published results. Prior to the paper being accepted for publication, the RDC can be used as a collaboration platform via which all kinds of files are shared (analysis scripts, preliminary figures, the different versions of the paper, &hellip;). To learn more about the files that you must upload to a RDC, see this FAQ.</p>
<p><strong>Data Sharing Collection (DSC)</strong><strong>.</strong> A DSC contains the data on which the published results are based, allowing other researchers to extend scientific findings by re-analyzing data with new methods, and/or by addressing new research questions using these data. To learn more about the files that you must upload to a DSC, see this FAQ.</p>
<h2>12. What are research data?</h2>
<p><em>Research data</em> are defined as follows:</p>
<p>All information that is (1) generated as a part of the research process and (2) on which a scientific report is/will be based.</p>
<p>This definition of research data does not only include empirical data, but also simulated data, computer scripts for analysis and simulations, stimuli presented in experiments and the computer scripts for presenting them, etc. A good way to determine what is the research data on which a study is based, is asking oneself what information has contributed to the results on which you report in your publication. And a good way to delineate the empirical from the other research data, is by asking oneself whether one has used some device for obtaining these data: empirical data are always collected using a device (a button box, a keyboard, an MRI scanner, an EEG or MEG system, a video camera, a touch screen, a microscope, &hellip;).</p>
<p>Not all studies and publications depend on research data, as defined above. This holds for theoretical, perspective and opinion papers, as well as for reviews. The Donders Repository is only relevant for those studies and publications that do depend on research data.</p>
<h2>13. What should I include in the abstract?</h2>
<p>The abstract should provide a short summary of the project. It can be a copy of the abstract of a corresponding manuscript that has been published, and can be extended with some details on the data that is shared.</p>
<p>The maximal length of an abstract is 2600 characters (including spaces).</p>
<h2>14. What are SfN keywords?</h2>
<p>The SfN keywords match the classification of presentations at the annual meeting of the Society for Neuroscience (<a href="https://www.sfn.org/">https://www.sfn.org/</a>).The specific list currently used in the Donders Repository is that of the 2013 SfN meeting. Using SfN keywords to describe the content of your collection allows it to be better indexed and found.</p>
<h2>15. What are MeSH keywords?</h2>
<p>MeSH are the Medical Subject Headings, i.e. the system of keywords that is being used by the U.S. National Library of Medicine and by PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/). MeSH is a comprehensive controlled vocabulary for the purpose of indexing journal articles and books in the life sciences; it serves as a thesaurus that facilitates searching. Using MeSH keywords to describe the content of your collection allows it to be better indexed and found. The whole structure of MeSH can be browsed here (<a href="https://www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/MBrowser.html">https://www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/MBrowser.html</a>).</p>
<h2>16. What is an organisational unit?</h2>
<p>An organizational unit is a section of the institute that has its own management and its own implementation of the RDM procedures. Within the Donders Institute there are four organisational units: the DCC, DCCN, DCMN and the DCN. Each of these has its own project management and for each of these the implementation of the procedures can be slightly different.</p>
<h2>17. Where should I apply for ethics approval for studies involving human participants?</h2>
<p>A lot of the research at the Donders Institute is covered by existing ethical agreements. If you are not sure whether you need to apply, please ask your local ethics officer or your <a href="mailto:datasupport@donders.ru.nl">data steward</a>. For the DCCN you can look up more details <a href="https://intranet.donders.ru.nl/index.php?id=4512">here</a>.</p>
<p>There are 23 <a href="http://www.ccmo.nl/en/accredited-mrecs">accredited METCs</a> in the Netherlands that review medical/scientific research proposals that involve human subjects. The majority are linked to an institution such as an academic medical centre or a hospital. The Faculty of Social Sciences at the Radboud University has its own <a href="http://www.ru.nl/socialsciences/ethics-committee/ethics-committee/">Ethics Committee</a> that is referred to as "ECSW". The Faculty of Humanities at the Radboud University has its own <a href="http://www.ru.nl/eac-humanities/">Ethics Committee</a> that is referred to as "EACH". As of recently, the Faculty of Science at the Radboud University also has its own Ethics Committee. Please contact Huub Zwarts or Frank van der Molen.</p>
<p>In case you need to apply for approval for studies that involve human participants, please ask your local ethics officer or your <a href="mailto:datasupport@donders.ru.nl">data steward</a> to support you with the procedure and ask for the template informed consent forms and brochures. These include the appropriate text on how we manage and share data.</p>
<h2 data-id="h35a6ab14-4886-4955-b888-d574621c5713">18. Where should I apply for ethics approval for studies that involve animals?</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.centralecommissiedierproeven.nl/">Centrale Commissie Dierproeven</a> (CCD) has approved 17 Animal Ethics Committees (Dierexperimentencommissie, DEC) in the Netherlands that review the applications for projects involving animal research. All research involving animals at the Donders Institute requires approval from the Radboud University&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.radboudumc.nl/en/research/technology-centers/animal-research-facility/dec">Animal Experiment Committee</a>.</p>
<h2 data-id="h35a6ab14-4886-4955-b888-d574621c5713">19. How should I specify the "ethics approval identifier"?</h2>
<p>Depending on the ethics approval board, the format of the identifier is slightly different. The identifier always specifies the board that approved it, followed by the number at which it is known at that board. Here are some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>CMO regio A-N 2014/288</li>
<li>ECSW 2013-0410-133</li>
<li>RUDEC 2013-180</li>
<li>IRBN 2014/005</li>
</ul>
<p>Besides the local ethics board identifier, an ABR ("Algemeen Beoordeling en Registratie") number might be assigned. The combination of these two ensures that the study is registered and can be identified both at the local as well as at the central level (i.e. at the CCMO in The Hague). Through the ABR number, the ethics application can be queried in a public database.</p>
<p>The ABR identifier is always of the form "NLxxxxx.xxx.xx". Here are some examples of ABR identifiers:</p>
<ul>
<li>NL57538.091.16</li>
<li>NL47093.091.13</li>
<li>NL45835.091.13</li>
</ul>
<p>On <a href="https://www.toetsingonline.nl/">www.toetsingsonline.nl</a> you can find details on studies with an ABR number.</p>
