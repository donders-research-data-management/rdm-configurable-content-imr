<h1>Share data</h1>
<h2>1. How do I share data with collaborators at the Donders/RU/UMC?</h2>
<p>If you are the manager of a collection you can easily share data with local collaborators for all collection types. Simply choose Edit -&gt; Add Contributor/Viewer and then select from the registered users. If your colleague is not yet in the list, instruct him/her to register an account on the Donders Repository using his/her u- or z-number as described <a href="http://www.ru.nl/donders/research/data/user-manual/get-started/login-portal/">here</a>.</p>
<h2>2. How do I share data with collaborators in the rest of the world?</h2>
<p>Sharing data with collaborators outside the local centers requires these collaborators to identify themselves through one of multiple mechanisms as described <a href="http://www.ru.nl/donders/research/data/user-manual/get-started/login-portal/">here</a>. The initiative for sharing the data comes from the collaborator as described <a href="http://www.ru.nl/donders/research/data/user-manual/access-shared-data/request-access/">here</a>. If a Data Acquisition Collection should be shared with outside collaborators, you need provide the collaborator with the URL to the repository based on the reserved persistent identifier, since the DAC will not be public.</p>
<h2>3. How do I share data with external reviewers?</h2>
<p>The Donders Repository includes the possibility of sharing data from a Data Sharing Collection with external reviewers (i.e. before publication) in a way that protects the anonymity of the reviewers. For details on this see the manual on <a href="http://www.ru.nl/donders/research/data/user-manual/archive-publish-collections/publish-dsc-share-data/">data sharing</a>.</p>
<h2><strong><em>4. Can I share my data through an external repository?</em></strong></h2>
<p>Data collected within the Donders Institute should in the first place be shared through the Donders Repository.</p>
<p>You may, however, want to add your data to a repository that is more common in your field, or a journal editor may oblige you to provide your data in an external repository.</p>
<p>This is allowed only if the external repository handles data in compliance with privacy legislation and RU RDM policy:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data ownership must remain in hands of the data creator (RU) only</li>
<li>The repository must allow (custom) Data Use Agreements that fit the type of research data, see <a href="http://www.ru.nl/donders/research/data/faq/closing-collections/#hc79c9bff-45dc-4c17-88df-e308601edcb8">this FAQ</a>.</li>
